# SpotiQue core

This is core of the system.

It plays songs added by the `API`.

## Installation

You can use `ansible`/`vagrant`, from a different repository. You may also run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To actually run the application, you need to get `spotify_appkey.key` file in root of this folder.

You also need to create `credentials.py` file, similarly to `credentials.py.example` file.
